For information about the MSDE 2000 Service Pack, see the
readmeSql2k32deskspX.htm file located in the same folder as this
file, where X is the number of the service pack.

The original release of MSDE 2000 included the original
SQL Server 2000 readme.txt file. The MSDE 2000 service packs
must include a readme.txt file to satisfy component
dependencies in Windows Installer patch files. The information
from the original readme.txt file has now been incorporated in
the latest versions of the SQL Server 2000 Books Online.
SQL Server 2000 service packs now publish their information in
HTML-based readme files.
